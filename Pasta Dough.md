## Ingredients
* 14 oz 00â€™ Flour (400g)
* 4 large eggs free range
* 1 egg yolk free range
## Directions
1. Place the flour on a clean work surface, make a well in the middle and add the eggs.
2. Using a fork whisk the eggs whilst slowly incorporating the flour until combined and looks like a very rough dough. You may need to use your hands once most of the egg is incorporated to help it along.
3. Bring the dough together with your hands to form a ball. Knead the dough for 10 minutes until smooth and pliable. Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to rest for 30 minutes, out of the fridge.
4. Once the dough is rested it's time to roll it out. Cut the dough in half so it's easier to roll out and flatten it with the palm of your hand so it will fit through the first setting on the pasta machine, usually 0.
5. Pass the dough through the widest setting once then fold one side over the other. Flatten the dough with the palm of your hand again so it will fit through the widest setting and roll it through again.
6. Repeat this process folding the sides in and passing it through the widest setting four times. Once you've done that pass the dough through each setting once from the widest to the second last setting.
