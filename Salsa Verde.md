## Ingredients
* 1 pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed
* 1 serrano pepper (or 2 jalapeño peppers), stem removed
* 2 cloves garlic, peeled
* 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves
* 1/3 cup diced white onion
* 1 tablespoon lime juice
* 1 teaspoon Kosher salt, or more to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425°F.
2. Rinse and dry the tomatillos. Then spread the tomatillos out evenly on a baking sheet (lined with foil!), along with the serrano pepper and garlic. Roast in the oven for 15 minutes (flipping often), or until the tomatillos start to brown on top and are cooked through.
3. Remove from the oven, and transfer the tomatillos, garlic, and serrano pepper to a blender or food processor. Add the cilantro, onion, lime juice, salt, and cumin to the blender or food processor, and pulse the mixture until it reaches your desired consistency. (Always be careful when blending hot mixtures, as they expand while blending.) Taste and season with extra salt and/or cilantro if needed.
4. Serve immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 5 days.
