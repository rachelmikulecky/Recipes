## Ingredients
* 2 chicken breasts
* 1/2 cup whole milk
* hot sauce
* 1 large egg
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 cup lard
* 1 cup vegetable oil
* Wonder bread, for serving
* Pickle chips, for serving

Sauce:
* 3 Tbsp cayenne pepper
* 1 Tbsp light brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 cup frying oil
## Directions
1. Cut the chicken breasts into quarters
2. If using previously frozen chicken, you'll likely want to dry brine them by generously coating both sides with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Place into a food-safe container and cover tightly with plastic wrap and put in the fridge for at least 4 hours.
3. Make the breading: combine whole milk with a few dashes of Louisiana hot sauce and egg. Beat together with a tiny whisk until no streaks remain. For the dry ingredients, combine flour, kosher salt, and a a tablespoon of the egg/milk mixture. This will create little chunks of breading which will help with crispiness.
4. First, the chicken goes into the flour mixture, then into the egg mixture, and then back into the flour mixture. This is commonly known as double-dipped fried chicken. Repeat with the remaining chicken and let it hang out in the flour while you prepare oil for frying.
5. In a high-walled frying pan or skillet, place lard and vegetable oil. Heat over medium-high heat and bring it to 325°F.
6. Gently lay the chicken pieces into the oil - making sure to place them going away from you to ensure no self-splattering. Fry for 5-7 minutes per side, or until deeply golden brown and crisp. Thinner chicken slices will likely cook through in this time - larger slices will need to be put in the oven.
7. Place on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and keep in a 325°F oven until they are thoroughly cooked through.
8. Generously brush down both sides of the chicken with the spice oil. If applied while the oil and the chicken are still hot, it's going to absorb into the crust without making it soggy.
9. For the proper Nashville style, place on a piece of Wonder bread topped with pickle chips.

Sauce:
1. To prepare the spice mixture, in a small bowl goes cayenne pepper, brown sugar, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and kosher salt. For a tame and less spicy version, you can reduce the cayenne pepper.
2. Whisk to combine. Put the spice mix in a heat-proof bowl.
3. Slowly add frying oil - add just enough to get to a thickened texture. Whisk to combine.
