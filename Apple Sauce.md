## Ingredients
* 3 lb apples
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
## Directions
1. Prepare the apples by slicing and coring them-- no need to peel, unless you want to.
2. Place the sliced apples, water and cinnamon in a large pot or saucepan set over medium heat.
3. Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until tender.
4. Use a food processor to "puree" the apples, keeping it slightly chunky. (Unless you put it in bags, then puree until smooth so the chunks don't get stuck)
5. Let the applesauce cool to room temperature, then store in the refrigerator for up to one week.
