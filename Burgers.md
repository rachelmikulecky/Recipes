## Directions
1. You know how to make a burger. This entry exists solely so that you don’t forget any ingredients.
2. But if you are an idiot of elephantine proportions, here's how to blurgler.

Ooni:
1. While the oven preheats on high, add the onions and jalapenos to brown up. The onions can handle more heat, so place them at the very back.
2. After the veggies are finished cooking (don't forget to flip), lower the heat and add the burgers. Don't place the burgers right at the back as you could with the onions, instead aim for a more centered position.
3. After flipping the burgers, place the buns at the front of the cast iron to get some gentle heating.
4. Once the burgers are cooked through, turn the ooni completely off and add the jalapenos and cheese. The residual heat will be plenty to melt the cheese.
5. Remove the buns and burgers and assemble.
