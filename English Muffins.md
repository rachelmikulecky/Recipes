## Ingredients
* 300 g bread flour
* 6 g yeast
* 6 g salt
* 15 g caster sugar
* 15 g softened butter, cut into small pieces
* 1 egg
* 6 fl oz milk
* semolina for dusting
## Directions
1. Tip the flour into a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle the yeast on one side of the flour and the salt on the other. Add the sugar, butter, egg, and milk, then mix together to form a soft dough.
2. Turn the mixture out of the bowl and knead for 10 minutes, or until soft, smooth, and stretchy. The dough will be very wet.
3. Lightly grease a large bowl. Place the dough in the oiled bowl, cover, and leave to prove for about one hour, until doubled in size.
4. Tip the dough out onto a well floured surface and roll thin enough to cut out 8 muffins.
5. Place the muffins on a semolina dusted tray and add semolina to the tops of the muffins. Leave to prove for another 30 minutes.
6. Preheat a cast iron-skillet on medium-low. Griddle the muffins for approximately 8-12 minutes, flipping halfway through.
