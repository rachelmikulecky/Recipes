## Ingredients
* Whole wheat flour
* Salt
* Oil or ghee
* Water
## Directions
1. Add water to a heap of flour. Knead and add more water until dough reaches a hydrated, smooth consistency. To further soften the dough, add a tablespoon of oil or ghee.
2. Pour a little bit of oil into a bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap for about 30 minutes.
3. Divide dough into balls that are slightly larger than a golf ball and place onto a baking sheet that is dusted with flour. Let the dough rest.
4. Thinly roll out the dough and place over an open stove. Remove once lightly browned and puffy. Brush with ghee, dust with a little bit of salt, and enjoy!
