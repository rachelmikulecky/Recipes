## Ingredients
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup water
* 2 tbsp grated fresh ginger
* 8 oz club soda
## Directions
1. Peel a chunk of the ginger with the tip of a teaspoon--the papery skin scrapes right off--and grate it, using the fine side of your grater. Place the ginger, sugar, and water in a saucepan over medium heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Turn off the heat and allow the mixture to steep for an hour.
2. Strain the mixture (discard the ginger solids) and allow to cool.
3. Pour three or four tablespoons (more or less depending upon how gingery you like it) of your syrup over ice and club soda. Bottle the rest of the syrup and store it in the refrigerator.
