## Ingredients

Filling:
* 3 large granny smith apples, peeled and cored
* 340 g golden raisins
* 170 g dried figs, chopped
* 85 g dried cherries
* 85 g dried apricots
* 2 tbsp crystallized ginger
* 150 g brown sugar
* 55 g butter
* 1 orange, zested and juiced
* 1 lemon, zested and juiced
* 120 ml spiced rum
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp allspice
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves

Crust:
* 380 g all purpose flour
* 50 g sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 225 g butter (2 sticks), cut into small pieces
* 60 ml water
* 60 ml apple juice
## Directions
1. Put all filling ingredients in a food processor and process until minced. Let sit in the fridge for at least 3 days.
2. Mix the flour, sugar, and salt until well blended. Add the butter and use your fingers to really work it in until you get a gravel-like consistency.
3. Moisten it with water and apple juice until you achieve a dense, sweet pastry dough. Knead it a bit for good measure.
4. Flatten it into a disk, wrap in plastic, and leave in the fridge for at least 15 minutes.
5. Spray a muffin tin and lightly flour your work surface. Roll out the dough in small batches to approx. 1/8-1/4 inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter to to cut circles in the dough and duck them neatly into the muffin tin. Cut away excess from the top.
6. Fill with the filling, leaving room for a top crust. Cut out top crusts using decorative shapes for authenticity, making sure they do not cover the pie completely, steam needs to be able to escape.
7. Once completed, pop them into a 400 degree oven for 18-20 minutes, until tops are golden brown. Afterwards, let them sit at least 15 minutes to set (and cool!)
8. Serve both warm and at room temperature.
