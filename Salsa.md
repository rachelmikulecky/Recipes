## Ingredients
* 1 1/4 lbs ripe Roma tomatoes (about 5 - 6)
* 1 (14.5 oz) can petite diced tomatoes
* 2 green onions, ends trimmed, chopped into thirds
* 1/3 cup chopped red onion (about 1/4 of a medium)
* 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and roughly chopped
* 1/3 cup fresh cilantro (about a handful)
* 1 large clove garlic, roughly chopped
* 2 Tbsp fresh lime juice
* 1/2 tsp chili powder
* 1/4 tsp ground cumin
* 1/2 tsp granulated sugar (optional)
* Salt and pepper to taste
## Directions
1. Combine all ingredients in a food processor and pulse in 1 second bursts until all ingredients are finely chopped.
2. Serve with tortilla chips. Note that salsa always tastes best after it's been refrigerated for a few hours, so if time allows let the flavors marinate together before serving.
3. Store in refrigerator up to 1 week.

Notes:
1. Use best quality tomatoes or salsa will be lacking in flavor.
2. Canned diced tomatoes with mild green chilis, or canned fire roasted tomatoes also work great as well.
3. For a slightly stronger onion flavor you can just omit green onions and use about 3/4 cup red onion (or 1/2 of a medium onion).
4. Sometimes I like to substitute a few canned chipotle peppers with some adobo sauce for the jalapeno. This is a spicier option.
5. For a thinner salsa, you can add in a bit of tomato juice or tomato sauce if desired.
