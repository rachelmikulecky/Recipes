## Ingredients
* 1 lb strawberries rinsed, hulled and thickly sliced
* 1/3 cup granulated sugar
* 1 Tbsp lemon juice (1/2 lemon)
## Directions
1. In a medium saucepan, combine sliced strawberries, sugar and lemon juice. Place over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Strawberries will release juice without any mashing required.
2. Reduce heat and simmer 20-23 min or until sauce is thickened, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Keep in mind sauce will thicken up slightly as it cools and even more with refrigeration.
