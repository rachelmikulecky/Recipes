## Ingredients
* 2 large sweet potatoes
* 1 cup beans rinsed and drained
* 1/2 cup prepared salsa plus additional for serving
* 4 large eggs
* 1-2 avocados sliced
## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Scrub the potatoes (do not peel or pierce) and arrange in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake until the potatoes are tender, 50-60 minutes, depending upon the size of your potatoes. Set aside until cool enough to handle.
2. Slice the potatoes in half lengthwise, then carefully scoop the insides into a mixing bowl. Add the beans and salsa to the mixing bowl, then mix to combine. Stuff the filling into a small casserole dish, making wells for each for the eggs. To ensure even egg cooking, make sure the well is as wide (or even a bit wider) as it is deep.
3. Crack one egg inside each well, then bake for 10-15 minutes, until the egg is just set (the deeper and narrower the well, the longer the eggs will take to cook; the wider the well, the faster). Serve immediately, topped with avocado and any other desired toppings.
