## Ingredients
* 240 g all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, melted
* 215 g packed brown sugar
* 100 g white sugar
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 1 egg
* 1 egg yolk
* 1 1/2 bars semi-sweet baker's chocolate/white chocolate
## Directions
1. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended.
3. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy.
4. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon.
5. Separate into 16 equal portions, roll into balls, and place on cookie sheet. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart.
6. Chill for at least one hour - this helps them keep their form without spreading out on the pan too much.
7. Bake for ~16 minutes in a 325Â° F preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
