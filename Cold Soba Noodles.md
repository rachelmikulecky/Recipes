## Ingredients

Dipping Sauce:
* 3/4 cup hot water
* 1 tsp hondashi
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup mirin
* 1/8 teaspoon sugar

Noodles:
* 1 teaspoon wasabi, or to taste
* 1.5 ounces peeled and finely grated daikon
* 2 trimmed and finely chopped green onions
* 2 bundles buckwheat soba
* 1 large sheet nori, cut into thin strips
## Directions
1. Mix together hot water and hondashi, whisking to combine. Add remaining dipping sauce ingredients and chill, whisking with ice if desired.
2. Set out 2 serving plates. Divide equally among plates: dab of wasabi, grated daikon, and scallions.
3. In the meantime, bring 2-quart pot of water to boil over high heat and add soba. Return water to boil and cook the noodles until tender but firm, 3 to 5 minutes. Have ready a large bowl or pot ready with ice water. Use strainer to remove soba from pot. Place soba into ice water and chill until noodles are cold. Drain noodles.
4. Divide noodles evenly between the two plates, mounding the noodles. Pour dipping sauce into individual little bowls to serve alongside noodles.
5. To eat, stir some daikon, wasabi, and green onion into dipping sauce. Take some noodles with chopsticks and dip.
