## Ingredients
* 3/4 cup butter, softened
* 1 cup packed brown sugar
* 1 large egg, room temperature
* 3/4 cup molasses
* 4 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons ground ginger
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 3/4 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
## Directions
1. In a large bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Add egg and molasses. Combine the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Cover and refrigerate until easy to handle, about 4 hours or overnight.
2. Preheat oven to 350Â°. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with floured 2-1/2-in. cookie cutters. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets.
3. Bake until edges are firm, 8-10 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool. Tint some of the frosting red and some green; leave remaining frosting plain. Decorate cookies.
