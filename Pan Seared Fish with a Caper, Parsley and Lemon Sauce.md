## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 lb thick cut cod (or other fish) fillet, cut into 4-5 pieces
* 4 tbsp fresh lemon juice, divided, one tbsp for the fish and 3 tbsp for the sauce
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter
* 5 medium cloves garlic, chopped
* 2 tbsp capers
* 1/2 cup dry vermouth, or dry white wine
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 dash cayenne powder
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper
## Directions
1. Sprinkle one tablespoon of lemon juice over the fillets and set them aside while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. Allow the lemon juice to sit on the cod at least 15 minutes, up to 30 minutes.
2. In a shallow bowl, mix together all the seasoned flour ingredients. Pat the fish dry and dredge in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the butter in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until the pan is hot and the oil is shimmering. Add the cod and cook for 5-6 minutes on the first side. The fish will take a couple of minutes to release from the pan. Once it does, keep an eye on it and check for browning. When it's a deep, golden brown, turn the fish.
4. Continue cooking the fish on the other side until it is browned and the fish is cooked through, about another 5-6 minutes. Add another tablespoon of olive oil if needed.
5. Remove the fish to a serving dish and let it rest while you make the sauce.
6. Add the garlic and capers to the pan and cook, stirring constantly for 30 seconds. Add the vermouth to deglaze. Bring it to a boil and scrape up all the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Boil for 1 minute. Then add the lemon juice and parsley. Stir to combine and bring to a boil again. Immediately pour the sauce over the fish and serve.
