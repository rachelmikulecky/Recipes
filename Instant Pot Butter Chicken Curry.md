## Ingredients
* 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts cut into bite-size pieces
* 4 tablespoons butter, or ghee
* 1 large onion, peeled and chopped
* 8 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons fresh grated ginger
* 1 tablespoon curry powder
* 2 teaspoons garam masala
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 15 ounces tomato sauce
* 1 cup heavy cream
* Chopped cilantro for garnish
## Directions
1. Place the butter, chopped onions, garlic, ginger, and all spices in the Instant Pot. Set on Sauté for 5 minutes. Stir to make sure the ingredients don't burn. Once the onions are soft, turn off.
2. Pour 1 cup water into the pot. Then use a wooden spoon to scrub the debris off the bottom of the pot. (This ensures the burn notice will not go off!)
3. Add the chopped chicken thighs and canned tomato sauce. Lock the lid into place and turn the Instant Pot on Pressure Cook High for 7 minutes. Once finished, turn the Instant Pot Off, then perform a Quick Release to release the steam pressure. Once the valve button drops, unlock the lid and remove.
4. Stir in the heavy cream. Set the Instant Pot on Sauté again and simmer for 2-5 minutes to thicken the sauce. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro and serve with basmati rice.
